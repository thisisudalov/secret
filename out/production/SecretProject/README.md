so, basic concept is that player always stays x-in-middle of screen,
while other context is moving around.
feature steps:
1) engine which lets you move w/a/d n place objects in view, tracking possible
collisions, so engineer can put some views on the screen n, f.e. jump over them.
2) maybe some object throwing/fighting elements, abilities like swinging on a
stick, jumping between two walls(just like atsasin/prince of persia)
